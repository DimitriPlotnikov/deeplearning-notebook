"From Digit Recongnition to Sentiment Analysis: Demystifying Neural Networks with PyTorch"

Imagine teaching a computer to read emotions in text as effortlessly as to recognize handwritten digits in MNIST. In this tutorial, we learn classic image classification with convolutional network and NLP by building a sentiment analysis model for IMDb movie reviews. Here’s why this matters:
* MNIST:
** Digit recongnition demonstrates how neural networks learn patterns in pixels.
** Then, we’ll apply the same principles to words, using PyTorch to classify positive/negative sentiment in text.
* The NBow Architecture:
** A "Neural Bag-of-Words" (NBow) model acts as the gateway to neural NLP.
** Simple yet powerful: it combines tokenization, embeddings, and linear layers to turn raw text into actionable predictions.
